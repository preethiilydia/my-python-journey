print ([[i,j,k] for i in range (x+1)
              for j in range (y+1)
              for k in range (y+1)
              if i+j+k!=n])

#Mistakes i made and points to remember:
1) x,y,z are ranges. and i,j,k are actual values.
2) why (x+1),(y+1),(z+1) ... because range(n) example means 0 to n-1. if n=2 then [0,1]
and if we want '2' value to be inclusive then, n+1, range(3), which will be [0,1,2]
