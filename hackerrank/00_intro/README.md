- [Arithmetic Operators](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/python-arithmetic-operators/problem)
- [Division](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/python-division/problem)

- ### [Loops](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/python-loops/problem)

**ðŸ“Œ Problem Explanation:**  
You're given an integer `n`. You need to print the squares of all non-negative integers less than `n`.

**ðŸ§  Key Concepts:**  
Use a `for` loop to iterate from `0` to `n-1`
Use exponentiation `**` or multiplication `*` to get the square

- ### [If-Else](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/py-if-else/problem)

**ðŸ“Œ Problem Explanation:**  
You're given an integer `n`. Based on whether it's odd or even and its value range, you must print `"Weird"` or `"Not Weird"` according to specific conditions.

**ðŸ”¢ Conditions:**
- If `n` is odd â†’ print `"Weird"`
- If `n` is even and between 2 and 5 â†’ print `"Not Weird"`
- If `n` is even and between 6 and 20 â†’ print `"Weird"`
- If `n` is even and greater than 20 â†’ print `"Not Weird"`
